# Xamarin_DoubleImages
Form POC of a contentview object composed of multiple elements, converted into Android and iOS

The spirit of this POC is to manage pressed and released tap event on composed contentview objet.
Curently, Xamarin Tap gesture recognizer works only with the "released" state.
Moreover, most of people need to create composed controls to be reused multiple time.
This project try to combine both.
